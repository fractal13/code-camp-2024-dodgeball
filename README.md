=========================

Hey there, Code Campers! Ready to kick off your coding journey? This kit is made for beginner programmers like you to jump into the fun at the [Southern Utah Code Camp 2024](https://southernutahcodecamp.com/)! Start with this kit, add your creativity, and wow the judges with your unique version!

Dodgeball
---------

Your starter project is called Dodgeball. Here’s what you get: there’s a single ball flying across the screen and a player character waiting in the center. You’ll use the arrow keys to control the player, but the rest? That’s up to your imagination!

Want to dodge more than one object? Want them flying in from all directions? Or maybe you’d rather have the player catch the objects? Make it your own! Add cool features and make it as fun or as challenging as you like.

The source code for the game is in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fractal13/code-camp-2024-dodgeball), and we’ve even provided [some tutorials](doc/assignment_dodgeball.md) to help you get started. Let’s see what you come up with!
